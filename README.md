It's not done. Go to https://alexa.technoguyfication.com

## How do I use it
* Clone the repo somewhere and find the `src` folder.
* Copy `config.default.php` to `config.php`
* Get your MySQL server and Apache/Nginx/PHP started.
* Run [this script](https://github.com/Technoguyfication/alexa-rest-api/blob/master/database-setup.sql) in your database to get that going
* [Create a reCAPTCHA site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin)
* Open up your shiny new `config.php` and put everything in there.
* It should work now
