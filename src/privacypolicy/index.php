		<h1 class="header">Alexa REST API Privacy policy</h1>
		<div class="maintext">
			<p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

			</ol>
			
			<p><strong>How do we use your information?</strong><br></p>
			<p>We may use the information we collect from you:</p>

				<li>Make a purchase</li>
				<li>Sign up for our newsletter</li>

				<li>To send periodic emails regarding your order or other products and services.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<p><strong>How do we protect your information?</strong><br></p>
			<p>We never ask for credit card numbers. We use regular Malware Scanning. Your personal information is contained
			behind secured networks and is only accessible by a limited number of persons who have special access rights to
			such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. In addition, all sensitive/credit information
			you supply is encrypted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology. We implement a variety of security measures when
			a user places an order enters, submits, or accesses their information to maintain the safety of your personal information.</p>
			
			<p id="cookies"><strong>Do we use cookies?</strong><br></p>
			<p>Yes. Cookies are small files that a site or its service provider transfers to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser
			(if you allow) that enables the site's or service provider's systems to recognize your browser and capture and remember certain
			information. For instance, we use cookies to help us remember and process the items in your shopping cart. They are also used to
			help us understand your preferences based on previous or current site activity, which enables us to provide you with improved services.</p>
			
			<p><strong>California Online Privacy Protection Act</strong><br></p>
			<p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach
			stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that operates websites
			collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly
			the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared.
			<a href="http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf" target="_blank">See more here.</a></p>
			<p>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Users can visit our site anonymously.</li>
				<li>Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website</li>
				<li>Our Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above</li>
				<li>You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes via email, and whenever logging into your account</p>
			</oL>
			
			<p><strong>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</strong><br></p>
			<p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in place.
			It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking.</p>
			
			<p><strong>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</strong><br></p>
			<p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act
			(COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out
			what operators of websites and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.</p>
			<p>We do not specifically market to children under
			the age of 13 years old.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Fair Information Practices</strong><br></p>
			<p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have played a significant
			role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented
			is critical to comply with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>
			<p>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
			the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We will notify you via email within 7 business days</li>
				<li>We will notify the users via in-site notification within 7 business days</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights against data collectors
			and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
			have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
			
			<p><strong>CAN SPAM Act</strong><br></p>
			<p>The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the right to have emails
			stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.</p>
			<p>We collect your email address in order to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions</li>
				<li>Process orders and to send information and updates pertaining to orders.</li>
				<li>Send you additional information related to your product and/or service</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.</li>
				<li>Identify the message as an advertisement in some reasonable way.</li>
				<li>Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.</li>
				<li>Honor opt-out/unsubscribe requests quickly.</li>
				<li>Allow users to unsubscribe by using the link at the bottom of each email.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you would like to unsubscribe from any email notification, follow the instructions at the bottom of any email received from our service to be removed from the list.</p>
